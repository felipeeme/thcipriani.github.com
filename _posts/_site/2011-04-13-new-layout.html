<p>So I&#8217;ve been playing with a new layout for the site - the colorscheme is based off of the textmate colorscheme &#8216;molokai&#8217;. The overall layout made its way onto github before it made its way into Photoshop, so everything is very rough, ethereal and, hopefully, soon to evolve into something muy muy bueno.</p>
