I've been wanting to post this up for a while; however, I needed to find a Mac on which I could 
record this screencast. It seems that currently the only browser that fully supports CSS 3d transitions 
is Safari. When I was building this page, Chrome on Ubuntu supported CSS3 
3d-transitions so I was able to see what I was doing. Later I built an analog of this effect using 
papervision 3d in flash and used modernizer.js to serve one or the other where appropriate; however, 
I think the CSS3 effect is far more impressive - frankly, I didn't want the rest of the world to miss out.

Also, you might want to take the volume down a notch before watching this video. I was sitting near a couple
servers when I recorded it, and, as such, there is quite a background racket.
