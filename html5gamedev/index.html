        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>

          I used a switch case - the same code I used in my detect keypress task. I'm wondering if that was the correct
          method of implementation - changing directions isn't too quick or responsive.

        <h4>Overview</h4>

        <p>
          I wasn't quite sure if this is what we're were trying to achieve - intially I had the jQuery animate() function as
          part of the mousemove event handler - which was an effect I actually liked a little better; however, the task
          instructions specifically advised against this and asked that you use and external function that is repeatedly called - setinterval
          is the appropriate function in this case.

        <p>
          Fairly happy with the overall movement - not sure if I should have done a background object - I might has well've.

        <p>
          I'm not sure why one piece seems to always move over the game board and the other one under.
